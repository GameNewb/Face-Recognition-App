# User Login and Face Recognition App
---------------------
This is a basic app that allows user to register and login to their appropriate profile. Once a user is logged in, users are able to upload videos through their local files and database.

The app is currently being developed using HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and Apache server on a Windows and Linux machine. Also, the app is dependent on the FFMPEG library as some functionalities require it.

---------------------
#### To run the program you must have the following installed on your system:

1. Apache server
2. MySQL
3. A text editor (e.g. Notepad++, SublimeText, Brackets, etc.) in case you want to make edits on the files
4. FFMPEG
----------------------
#### Additional Dependencies:
- FFMPEG is included in this project repo. On Windows, you can simply add an environmental path to the ffmpeg folder and the dependencies will be fixed.
